# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work.

This Prework Study Guide was created for bootcamp students who are going through the pre-work. As a bootcamp student, I wanted the prework to be structured on a webpage so that myself or other students could easily find and read the information. The page provides some notes on the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

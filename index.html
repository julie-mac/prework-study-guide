        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Before including the head or body though, you must insert the doctype and the language of your site.</li>
          <li>The title within the head is what shows up to users on the browser's tab or title bar.</li>
          <li>The meta (or metadata) elements within the head are not visible to users, as it's the information used by the browser itself. </li>
          <li>Meta elements include the viewport (sets the default view for the page), charset (to set our character encoding) and http-equiv (sets our HTTP header for content).</li>
          <li>Within the body, there are header elements (h1-h6) that go from biggest to smallest, with h1 being the bigger one always at the top of the page and h6 being the smallest. It's important to go in order here to provide a user-friendly experience.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph, which you will use to present most of your text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about a photo displayed on the website, and contains attributes like the src, alt, height and width.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line break to separate content.</li>
          <li>To create a hyperlink, use the a element (stands for anchor!) and href to point to whatever link you'd like to use.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Your selector is whatever element (header, footer, list, etc.) you want to a property to.</li>
          <li>Properties include color, text-align, margin, padding, height, width, and many more.</li>
          <li>After every property, you assign a value. For example: header {color:blue;}</li>
          <li>You can assign the same properties to multiple selectors at once to help reduce the amount of code needed.</li>
          <li>The margin indicates how much space you want around an element.</li>
          <li>The padding indicates how much space you want around the content *inside* the element. It's often confused with the margin.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow property does what it sounds like... It's described by (x,y) offsets relative to the element, as well as blur and spread radius, and colour.</li>
          <li>Inside your html code, you must always link your css style sheet to it. Place this piece of code below your last meta element and just before the title element of the webpage.</li>
          <li>Putting a period before a selector (like all the card elements in these sections! ".card") applies whatever property to all elements identifying with the said selector.</li>

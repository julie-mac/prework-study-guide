        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Before including the head or body though, you must insert the doctype and the language of your site.</li>
          <li>The title within the head is what shows up to users on the browser's tab or title bar.</li>
          <li>The meta (or metadata) elements within the head are not visible to users, as it's the information used by the browser itself. </li>
          <li>Meta elements include the viewport (sets the default view for the page), charset (to set our character encoding) and http-equiv (sets our HTTP header for content).</li>
          <li>Within the body, there are header elements (h1-h6) that go from biggest to smallest, with h1 being the bigger one always at the top of the page and h6 being the smallest. It's important to go in order here to provide a user-friendly experience.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph, which you will use to present most of your text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about a photo displayed on the website, and contains attributes like the src, alt, height and width.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line break to separate content.</li>
          <li>To create a hyperlink, use the a element (stands for anchor!) and href to point to whatever link you'd like to use.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Your selector is whatever element (header, footer, list, etc.) you want to a property to.</li>
          <li>Properties include color, text-align, margin, padding, height, width, and many more.</li>
          <li>After every property, you assign a value. For example: header {color:blue;}</li>
          <li>You can assign the same properties to multiple selectors at once to help reduce the amount of code needed.</li>
          <li>The margin indicates how much space you want around an element.</li>
          <li>The padding indicates how much space you want around the content *inside* the element. It's often confused with the margin.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow property does what it sounds like... It's described by (x,y) offsets relative to the element, as well as blur and spread radius, and colour.</li>
          <li>Inside your html code, you must always link your css style sheet to it. Place this piece of code below your last meta element and just before the title element of the webpage.</li>
          <li>Putting a period before a selector (like all the card elements in these sections! ".card") applies whatever property to all elements identifying with the said selector.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git clone repository-url: clones remote repository onto local computer</li>
          <li>git remote -v: verifies connection of the repository</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages changes made to your code</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To link your html and javascript, you must enter a link element into the head element of your html code.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Using console.log() displays whatever you put between the brackets in the console.</li>
          <li>JavaScript reads code in a top-to-bottom manner, so the order of your code matters (Control Flow). A lot!</li>
          <li>Conditional statements like "if" and "for" are used to disrupt the Control Flow.</li>
          <li>An if statement can be used so a piece of code only runs if certain conditions are met. </li>
          <li>If statements can be followed by "else" to place other conditions for different results.</li>
          <li>There are three types of values: strings, numbers, and boolean (true/false).</li>
          <li>An array [] can hold different kinds of data, and the positions of the values within them are zero-indexed and sequentia.</li>
          <li>An example of an array: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"]; // The triangle is indexed at the 0 position of the shapes array: shapes[0] = triangle</li>
          <li>A for loop uses a pattern to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single block of code to execute over and over again until there are no items left.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three important statements - The starting point; A condition; and The pattern.  </li>
          <li>An example of the for loop: for(var x = 0; x < array.length; x++) {then on the next line you put your code block!}</li>
          <li>The .length after the array declares the length of the... you guessed it. The array!</li>
          <li>x++ is shorthand for x+1.</li>
          <li>A function performs a set of tasks when called.</li>
          <li>To create a function, you must declare it, like this: function myFunction() {code block on next line}</li>
          <li>You must always include parentheses after declaring a function, even when nothing is going inside.</li>
          <li>In order for a function to run, you must call it: myFunction(); // Pretty simple right?</li>
          <li>If you want to render a piece of code inactive temporarily, you can comment it out by using /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
